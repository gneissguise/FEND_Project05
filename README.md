# Udacity Fend Restaurant Review App


## How to install and run

* Clone this repository into a directory that you have access to:
`git clone https://github.com/gneissguise/FEND_Project05.git`

* Run an HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 
  * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

*Once your server is running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
